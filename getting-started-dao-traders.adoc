:!figure-caption:

This guide will show you how to use BSQ to get up to 90% lower trading fees. Using BSQ also compensates Bisq's contributors, making the Bisq network a sustainable free software project.

Bisq's token is a bit different from most other exchange tokens: its primary reason to exist is to enable the decentralized operation and management of the Bisq network. That means no central wallets or accounts to accumulate funds, and and no legal entity or leadership team to control strategy. See more details <<user-dao-intro#, in this doc>> or in https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFH5SztL5cYPAXWFz-IMB4dBZ0MEZEG_e[these videos^].

For you, as a trader, discounted trading fees are a practical result of this approach: the mechanisms above require that trading fees be paid in BSQ, so the software encourages traders to pay fees with BSQ by making them cheaper.

Let's see how to take advantage of this.

== Trading BSQ

Although BSQ is <<dao-technical-overview#bsq-token, technically bitcoin>>, it's colored bitcoin that must be kept in a Bisq wallet, separate from plain bitcoin.

=== Get Your BSQ Address

You can find your BSQ wallet address in `DAO` > `BSQ wallet` > `Receive`.

[NOTE]
.What is instant trading?
====
For altcoins, Bisq offers instant trading, which shortens the trade period to a _maximum_ of 1 hour. Everything else about the trade is the same: you must still post a security deposit, usual dispute resolution (e.g., arbitrators) is still available, etc.

Instant trading is only available for altcoins right now, and it's only available for accounts configured to be for instant trading.
